# Automation-scripts

This repo includes various scripts written in python 2.7 which are used by me to automate some processes.
I made these scripts not only to automate my work but also because coding is fun :D 
All the scripts are in Scripts folder.

search_stackoverflow.py -> This script takes a query from user and then opens the top 5 results in the user's default webbrowser.
Note- I have only tested it in firefox until now.
